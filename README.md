# üêç Simple Python Ticket Booking System

This is a **beginner-friendly project** developed to practice core Python programming fundamentals and file management. The system simulates a basic ticket booking service, allowing customers to book tickets for an event or service directly through a command-line interface.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This Python-based system allows customers to book tickets through a command-line interface. The system collects essential passenger details and stores them in a plain text file, ensuring that each booking is recorded and persisted.

**Key Features:**

  * **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Fully operational in the terminal, demonstrating strong input/output handling.
  * **Data Persistence:** Booking records are stored in a local plain text file, ensuring data is retained across sessions.
  * **User Data Collection:** The system collects and records essential passenger details for each booking.
  * **Basic Error Handling:** Simple logic is included to guide the user and manage invalid inputs gracefully.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

  * **Language:** Python 3.x

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dhruv-dosh/TicketFlow_Practice_Project](https://github.com/dhruv-dosh/TicketFlow_Practice_Project)
    cd TicketFlow_Practice_Project
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the main Python script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python IRCTC.py
    ```

## üß† Learning Goals Achieved

This project was specifically designed to help users (and the creator\!) practice:

1.  **File I/O:** Reading from and appending data to local text files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`).
2.  **User Interaction:** Implementing loops and validation for command-line inputs (`input()`).
3.  **Data Modeling:** Representing booking records using fundamental Python data structures (dictionaries or lists).
4.  **Functional Programming:** Breaking the system logic down into clear, manageable functions.
